		On this page, I will be sharing my favorite places in Michigan, my home state, that I have traveled to. 
		<h2 class="headings">
			Huntington Woods 
		</h2>
			<p class="para">
				Huntington Woods is my hometown where I grew up. It is a tiny square mile town only hosts 6,000 residents. 
				The only buildings in it besdies homes, is a library and an elementary school. It is my favorite place. 
				I made the best friends, had great education, and will always have somewhere to come back to. Generations of 
				my family have lived in Huntington Woods beginning with my great grandparents. I plan on continuing the tradition
				and starting a family there.

			Up North
		</h2>
			<p class="para">
				Up north is a magical place. It is my home away from home. I have gone to summer camp there for 
				nine years and have gone up there every summer since with friends are family. There are many gorgeous
				hiking trails, orchards and farms for fruit picking, and many Great Lakes and beautiful waters and beaches. 
				Northern Michigan holds a special place in my heart.

			Upper Peninsula (UP)
		</h2>
			<p class="para">
				The Upper Peninsula is a very special aspect of Michigan. Though it is very far from my hometown,
				it is a great place. There is always an adventure to be had there. I have only been there with my camp and each 
				time is better than the last. We completed hiking trips through Isle Royal and Pictured Rocks. They are two of 
				Michigan's breathtaking National Parks. I hope I go back there in the near future.
